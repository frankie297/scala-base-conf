# Scalabase Conf 14 May 2021
Scalabase is a new mini-conference that will run on the 14th of May, right before this year's ScalaCon. 
It's aimed at developers who are relatively new to Scala (<= 3 years experience). 

## Vision
Scalabase is a welcoming and safe space for developers who are in the early stages of their Scala journeys. 

Most Scala conferences are aimed at proficient Scala developers. 
This often means that for new developers it can be difficult to understand the conference talks. 
Scalabase aims to solve this problem. It is a conference specifically aimed at developers who are new to Scala (and not just coming from a Java background). 

We envisage that all the speakers at Scalabase are engineers in the early part of their Scala careers presenting topics that are accessible to beginners. 

There will be a support programme for speakers to receive mentoring from a senior Scala developer and experienced speaker, so that they can get help preparing their talk. 
We hope that this will encourage more speakers from under-represented groups in particular.

## Speakers
We're looking for junior Scala developers who may be interested in speaking and would like help to prepare a talk.

We want to increase the pool of potential speakers by providing mentoring to help relatively new developers create a talk. 
If you know someone who you think could benefit from a bit of help to prepare a talk, and fit our criteria, please get in touch. 
If you are such a person, please get in touch as well! Our email address is scalabase@googlegroups.com.

Also, we would love to hear from more senior Scala developers who have given talks aimed at beginner Scala devs in the past.

In this case, we offer speakers the opportunity to practice their talk with a couple of junior Scala developers to ensure it's as accessible to juniors as possible.

## Mentors
We're looking for Scala developers who are interested in mentoring a junior dev on preparing a talk. 
We are looking for experienced developers who are willing to dedicate an hour a week for 3-4 weeks to guide and give advice to a junior colleague. 
We are hoping this will help increase the pool of potential conference speakers in the future. 
If you are such a person (or you know someone who would be interested), please get in touch! Our email address is scalabase@googlegroups.com.

## Attendees
This conference is free! Registration and sign-up details will be available soon. 

It will run on Friday 14 May in UK time, the exact times are TBD and it will be online!
